A web application for the 1530 class at University of Pittsburgh

Bark-in is a social networking application that allows dog owners to schedule visits to parks as well as view what other dogs will be at the park at that time. Owners can view various traits about the dogs such as temperament, size, vocalization, etc. The application will also allow park visitors to post reviews and ratings of the various dog parks that they visit, based on maintenance and cleanliness, as well as view how busy the parks are at various times and days of the week. The main purpose of the application is to allow dog owners to decide whether they want to visit a specified dog park at a given time based on what dogs are/will be there and user reviews about the park.
